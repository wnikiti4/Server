## Contributing

Please feel free to fork and contribute to the data set in compliance with the issued license. The intention is to have it as a playground use case for manifold data on the web approaches to smart home data.

## The Data

The data set comprises static and dynamic building data. The data is hosted until 30 July 2019 in a GraphDB triple store sponsored by Ontotext: [https://rdf.ontotext.com/4139541402/mydb/repositories/OpenSmartHomeDataSet](https://rdf.ontotext.com/4139541402/mydb/repositories/OpenSmartHomeDataSet). We are currently searching for a new home for the repo, as the GraphDB cloud services ends operation at the 30 July 2019.

## Sensor and Actuator Data Description

The CSV files stored in Measurement folder are named and each contain one time series of measured data. The values are obtained for the Bathroom, Kitchen, Room 1, Room 2, Room 3 and the Toilet. The respective time series are stored separated by a tab, where the first column contains the UNIX time and the second is the reading of the sensor. A dot is used to denote floating point numbers. Moreover, the following applies to the data:

- ThermostatTemperature -> This is the air temperature measured at the thermostat mounted to the radiator. There is one room (Room 2) which has two Thermostats. The value is measured in degree Celsius and given as a floating point number.
- Brightness -> This is the brightness measured by the luminance sensor placed in each room. It is reported as a floating point number and is unit is lux. 
- Humidity -> This is the relative humidity of the air inside each room measured by the humidity sensor mounted to the wall. It return the relative humidity in percent as a integer number.
- Temperature -> This is the indoor air temperature in degree celsius measured by the temperature sensor placed in each room.
- SetpointHistory -> This is the setpoint for the room in degree Celsius as a floating point number as defined by the schedule of the controller.
- OutdoorTemperature -> This is the outside air temperature as obtained from a virtual weather service in degree celsius and stored as a floating point number.
